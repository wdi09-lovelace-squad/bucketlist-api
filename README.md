Besides finishing WDI, you surely have one or two things you'd love to do with your life. Let's get 'em on paper! You could integrate with a third-party location-based API to allow users to search for a location or venue to add to their bucket list items.

**Reach Goal**: Add social features to your site, such as following other users. Allow users to make certain list items public, but default to private.
