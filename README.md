### Project Details

Besides finishing WDI, you surely have one or two things you'd love to do with your life. Let's get 'em on paper! You could integrate with a third-party location-based API to allow users to search for a location or venue to add to their bucket list items.

Reach Goal: Add social features to your site, such as following other users. Allow users to make certain list items public, but default to private.

### Generate a New Express App
- Kelvin created a git repo
- Allie generated the express app. (`express --hbs --git --force`)
- Allie performd the 'initial' commit. (`git add . && git commit -m 'Initial commit'`)
- Allie installed dependencies. (`npm install`)
